# Foodiegram

A dynamic site built with Node.js, Express and MongoDB Atlas.

## Introduction

This site was built as a code along project from Colt Steele's web developer bootcamp.
I decided to branch off from the real Yelpcamp project and build my own - Foodiegram -
a site to share your favorite recipes and pictures of your food. I really enjoyed this
project and learned a lot about developing with node, express and mongo to build 
full-stack web apps. To make the site my own I also implemented Bootstrap's masonry 
layout from Bootstrap 4.
